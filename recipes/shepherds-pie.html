    <h2>What is Shepherd's Pie?</h2>

    <p>Shepherd's pie, cottage pie, or in French cuisine hachis Parmentier, is a savoury dish of cooked minced meat topped with mashed potato and baked, formerly also called Sanders or Saunders. The meat used may be either previously cooked or freshly minced. The usual meats are beef or lamb. The terms shepherd's pie and cottage pie have been used interchangeably since they came into use in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, although some writers insist that a shepherd's pie should contain lamb or mutton, and a cottage pie, beef.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Ground Beef: You could also ground lamb if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Mashed Potatoes: Use starchy potatoes (like russet or Yukon Gold) for the best mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes are also made with butter, onion, and Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>Vegetables: This shepherd's pie includes carrots and onions.</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour will thicken the beef gravy.</li>
        <li>Ketchup: Ketchup will add a little tang to the ground beef mixture.</li>
        <li>Beef Broth: Beef broth creates a gravy-like consistency in the middle.</li>
        <li>Cheese: Top the shepherd's pie with extra Cheddar for a cheesy finish.</li>
    </ul>
